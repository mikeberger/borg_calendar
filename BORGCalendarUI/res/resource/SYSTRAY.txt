BORG supports a systray icon for Windows only.

To get systray working, the file TrayIcon.dll must either be in
the BORG working directory or in the windows SYSTEM folder. The working
directory is usually the directory containing the borg.jar file.

The source code supporting the windows tray icon is not shipped
with BORG as it is not part of BORG. Only the binary files -
TrayIcon.dll and the com/jeans/trayicon/*.class files are included.
This is all that is needed to build BORG.

The trayicon software was written by Jan Struyf, who is not affiliated
with this project. Check his website for more information.
Thanks to Jan for making his software freely available.

Here is the information found in the source:
