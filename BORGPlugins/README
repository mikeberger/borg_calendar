The BORG Plugins Project contains items that are not supported officially. They provide
rarely used functionality that pulls in lots of third-party JARS. 

The project will be in SVN on sourceforge, but not put into file releases.

If you want to get the plugins, build this project and copy the jars from the dist and lib folders
into the borg lib folder. Then run BORG and the Plugins menu should show the plugin 
menu items.

Current plugins: 

- Reports - Jasper Reports and a GANTT chart for BORG. Rarely used. The Jasper files are way out of date.

- ICal - Imports Ical files into BORG. Works for me from Thunderbird/lightning/davmail/exchange. Amazing useful, but it would
be impossible to debug everyone's particular Ical issues, so it's a plugin. It's also not worth all of the third party jars that
would need to be released with borg.

- Google - syncs BORG with google calendar. Due to the incompatibility between the calendars, some appointments do not sync or sync
incorrectly. Some BORG features (like Color) do not get sent over to google. The google APIs are not well documented, so I just
don't have the patience to get everything working 100% by trial and error.
