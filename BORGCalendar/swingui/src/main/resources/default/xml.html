<P>BORG can
export/import its data to/from XML. The import/export actions can be
found on the month view Action menu. Import/Export provides a good
way to backup your database in human readable/editable form.</P>
<P>Users are
strongly encouraged to turn on the automatic backup feature which
exports the entire database to a time-stamped zip file when borg
shuts down.</P>
